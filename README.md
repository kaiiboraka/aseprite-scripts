## -- Installation --

Open the Scripts folder via `File->Scripts->Open Scripts Folder`. Simply move the files into that folder (or your own subfolder) to install. Once there, scripts can be run via `File->Scripts->SCRIPT NAME`. You may need to restart Aseprite first for the scripts to show up.

It is also possible to assign scripts to custom keyboard shortcuts of your choosing.

## -- Scripts --

### -- Color Compliment --

This script asks for a single color and returns the HSV color compliment according to the color wheel.

### -- Hue Generator --

This script asks for two colors and the number of intermediate colors you wish to generate. The script will then give a window with a range of colors between the two that were given.

### -- Shade Generator --

This script will give a range of shades brighter and darker than the color that is given, ranging from black up to white.
